# Polish translation for pdScript IDE

[Polish version / Polska wersja](Readme_PL.md)

## Overview
**pdScript IDE** (*Precision Delphi Script IDE*) is a small integrated development environment for the **pdScript** (*Precision Delphi Script*) interpreter, which in turn is a standalone executable interpreter of the RemObjects [Pascal Script](https://www.remobjects.com/Ps.aspx) language with a few extras.

The program allows you to write, run and debug Pascal Scripts. It also has a built-in form designer, object inspector, tool palette, and allows you to create scripts with a graphical user interface. Moreover, the program can compile scripts into the standalone executable file (EXE).

The pdScript IDE is a bit outdated (the last version released in 2013), but still very useful, that's why I decided to write a Polish translation.

## Installation

- Download the above ZIP file and extract it to the pdScript IDE directory (it should contain the subdirectories `Lang` and `Extras`). You must confirm overwriting several files (this is necessary).
- Run the pdScript IDE and select menu **Tools** --> **Options**. A new window will appear with the program settings.
- Choose Polish language on the *User interface language* drop-down list and click **OK**.
